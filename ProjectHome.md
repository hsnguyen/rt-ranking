Liquid chromatography is one step in shotgun proteomics assay that separates peptides based on their hydrophobicity on a chromatography column. Retention time is the time that a peptide will spend on the column, and this feature could be predicted by studying the characteristics of the peptide sequence alone. There are several regression models are built to do this task. Due to the limited time, the problem is reduced to predicting the order of a list of peptides using machine-learned ranking (MLR).
